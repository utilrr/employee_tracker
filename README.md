# Employee Tracker

## Employee Tracker is a mySQL2 database with a command line prompt-based interface. It allows managers to view departments, roles, and employees in their company so that they can plan and organize their business.

## Aims/Goals
1. When I choose to view all departments I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
2. When I choose to view all roles I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
3. When I choose to view all employees I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
4. When I choose to add a department I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
5. When I choose to add a role I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database,
6.When I choose to add an employee I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
7.When I choose to update an employee role I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
8. When I decide to delete a department, role or employee I can do so with one click and immediately see the adjusted table from the database.

## Technologies Used
Node, MySQL2, MySQl Workbench, JavaScript, Express, Inquirer
## Challenges Faced

I had several challenges with MySQL & Homebrew, installing and uninstalling multiple times. Initially it worked fine, but something changed & I spent several hours trouble shooting the issue(s) with the able help of a tutor and 4-5 TA's. I spent time also figuring out how to switch from a .bash shell to .zshrc shell.
